# Inertia-Matrix-Inverse

This repository provide a small set of follow up materials to the technical report: 
Analytical Inverse of the Joint Space Inertia Matrix, by Justin Carpentier

A MATLAB implementation of the algorithm is provided that is compatible with Featherstone's spatial_v2 MATLAB package. http://royfeatherstone.org/spatial/v2/

A small set of PDF annotations on the technical report further describes the relationship of the algorithm with Featherstone's Articulated Body Algorithm, and notes a minor technical update to the algorithm necessary for its correctness.
